This project is developed in SIOTLAB in Santa Clara University by Puneet Kumar (PhD student) under professor Behnam Dezfouli. 

This project is an attempt to implement kQUIC which is QUIC inside kernel.
Since kernel size is too big, the touched files are in their respective folders.

Create a normal client and server file to open connect and send data over a QUIC socket.
Use symbol IPPROTO_QUIC for socket establishment. 

Installing the kernel:
1. Clone the Linux source.
2. Add Linux files from the tar folder.
3. Modify the make file to compile the quic related files, as they are new
4. Compile and install the linux.

Usage:
1. Socket type is IPPROTO_QUIC, and socket opening is normal procedure just like UDP or TCP socket.
2. Write and read system calls just works normally.
3. Associated the above msghdr struct with the socket APIs for application multiplexing.

For ancillary data use:
  struct msghdr *msg
  and cmag_type is the field which will be application ID.
