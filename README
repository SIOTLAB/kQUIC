This project is an attempt to implement kQUIC which is QUIC inside kernel.
Since kernel size is too big, the touched files are in their respective folders.

Create a normal client and server file to open connect and send data over a QUIC socket.
Use symbol IPPROTO_QUIC for socket establishment. 

For ancillary data use:
  struct msghdr *msg
  and cmag_type is the field which will be application ID.
